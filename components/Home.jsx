      <h1>Hey, my name is Justin Lieng...</h1>
      <p>I am currently 22 years old and studying Computer Science at California State University Fullerton. 
        This is my 4th year at CSUF, so I will be graduating after Spring Semester of 2024.
        I decided to major in Computer Science because ever since I was a young child, I was always around computers.
        I just gravitated towards technology in general and when the time came to deciding a major, I was not hesitant
        at all. I have no regrets going into this field not just because I enjoy it but becayse I don't see myself doing
        anything else. I hope you enjoy my portfolio website that I've created, please take a look around and come again!
      </p>
      <h1>Skills</h1>
      <p>Some of my programming related skill include: </p>
      <h2>Languages</h2>
      <h2>Developer Workflow</h2>
    </div>
    </div>
